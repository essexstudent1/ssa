- MQTT is a compact client-server publish/subscribe messaging protocol that is designed for erratic or latency-prone networks. Applications like as telemetry, sensor networks, smart metering, home automation, messaging, and notification services are all appropriate fits for this protocol.
The Gateway offers straightforward integration APIs and includes typical Thingsboard-related functions including device setup, local data persistence and delivery, message converters, and others.
In order to handle data from devices, you can also create a custom converter that will take the data from the device and convert it to a uniform format before delivering it to the ThingsBoard cluster.
